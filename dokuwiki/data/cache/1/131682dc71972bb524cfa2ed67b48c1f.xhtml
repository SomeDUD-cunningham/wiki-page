<p>
The 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) scandal is one of the largest
financial frauds in recent history, involving a state-owned investment fund in
Malaysia. Initially set up in 2009 by then-Prime Minister Najib Razak to promote
economic development, the fund became embroiled in a multi-billion-dollar
money laundering and embezzlement scandal.

<div class="level3">

<p>
In 2009, then-Prime Minister Najib Razak established 1MDB, a sovereign wealth
fund, aiming to drive economic growth and infrastructure development, and reduce
poverty. The funds were to be used for securing investment in projects that would be
beneficial for the country and the people. However, the funds were instead stolen,
laundered and used for lavish personal expenditures.
</p>

<p>
Jho Low, a malaysian businessman, was a key mastermind behind this scandal having
used the funds for his personal use and even purchasing luxury property and artworks.
The funds raised by 1MDB were diverted through a series of corrupt transactions and
shell companies. A significant portion was funneled to Low who had close ties to Najib
and others in the government. 
</p>

<p>
These misappropriated funds were used to purchase luxury assets worldwide, including high-end real estate in New York, London, and Los Angeles. For example, Low used stolen 1MDB funds to buy a $250 million yacht and a
$35 million penthouse. He also financed the production of the Hollywood film The Wolf
of Wall Street through a company linked to Najib’s stepson, Riza Aziz. It was revealed
that millions of dollars from 1MDB were spent on personal luxuries like expensive
artwork and jewelry. $1 billion of stolen funds went to shell companies that hid the true
origins of the money, making it difficult to trace.
</p>

<p>
The scandal had involved several countries, including the United States, Switzerland,
and Singapore. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) launched a civil suit in 2016
seeking to recover more than $1.7 billion in assets linked to the corruption, including
luxury real estate, art, and even a private jet. The DOJ&#039;s suit described how the stolen
funds were used to fund political contributions, including $8 million funneled into a
campaign to support the re-election of former U.S. President Barack Obama.
</p>

<p>
In 2020, Goldman Sachs, an investment bank that helped facilitate bond sales for
1MDB, reached a $3.9 billion settlement for its role in the scandal. The bank’s
involvement included underwriting $6.5 billion in bonds, a portion of which was siphoned
off to the criminals behind the operation.
</p>

<p>
While Najib Razak was arrested and convicted in Malaysia, facing charges of
embezzlement and money laundering, Jho Low remains a fugitive. He is believed to be
hiding in China or the Middle East, and despite international warrants for his arrest, he
has not yet been captured.
</p>

<p>
The 1MDB scandal underlines the issue of state capture where leaders use state
resources for personal enrichment. It exposed how public funds can be easily
misappropriated and laundered through complex financial networks, crossing borders
without immediate detection.
</p>

<p>
In Malaysia, the corruption investigation helped lead to Najib Razak’s defeat in the 2018
general elections, ending his political career. The scandal also underscored the need
for greater financial transparency and stricter regulations to prevent such massive
abuses of power in the future.
