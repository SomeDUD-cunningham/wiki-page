The Paradise Papers are a set of 13.4 million electronic files that were leaked from an unknown source to the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. Afterwards, Süddeutsche Zeitung shared the leaked files with the Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) which collaborated with more than 380 journalists across the globe. Some details were made public on 5 November 2017
</p>

<p>
The Paradise Paper documents contain details of offshore investments. The documents contain emails, loan agreements and other forms of paperwork from the offshore legal firm Appleby, corporate service providers Estera and Asiacti,, as well as company registries from 19 tax jurisdictions.
</p>

<p>
According to the BBC, the name “Paradise Papers” originates from the term for which many offshore jurisdictions are dubbed, being coined with names like “tax havens” and “tax paradises”.

On 20 October 2017, a now deleted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PanamaPapers/comments/77n6ix/do_not_give_up_more_is_coming/" class="urlextern" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/PanamaPapers/comments/77n6ix/do_not_give_up_more_is_coming/" rel="ugc nofollow"> Reddit</a> account hinted at the existence of the papers, mentioning the word “Pandora” at the end of the post. The Following month, the ICIJ confronted and accused the offshore legal firm Appleby for its associations to the Paradise Papers.
</p>

<p>
Appleby announced that there was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/05/offshore-law-firm-appleby-response-no-evidence-wrongdoing-paradise-papers" class="urlextern" title="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/05/offshore-law-firm-appleby-response-no-evidence-wrongdoing-paradise-papers" rel="ugc nofollow">&quot;no evidence of wrongdoing&quot;, and that &quot;are unfounded and based on a lack of understanding of the legitimate and lawful structures used in the offshore sector.&quot;</a>
</p>

<p>
On December 18 2017, Appleby pressed charges against the ICIJ&#039;s UK parters, being the BBC and the Guardian, in an attempt to seek damages for both the disclosure of what it claimed were confidential legal documents obtained in a hack, and disclosure of any documents that had informed the news organizations’ reporting, according to the Guardian On May 4 of the next year, Appleby dropped the charges against the Guardian and the BBC coming to a <a href="https://www.icij.org/inside-icij/2018/05/paradise-papers-icij-partners-appleby-agree-settlement/" class="urlextern" title="https://www.icij.org/inside-icij/2018/05/paradise-papers-icij-partners-appleby-agree-settlement/" rel="ugc nofollow">settlement</a> instead.
