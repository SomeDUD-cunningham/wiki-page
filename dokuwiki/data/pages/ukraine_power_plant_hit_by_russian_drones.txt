Feb 16 2025 - A Ukrainian power plant was hit by Russian drones overnight in Mykolaiv, located in Southern Ukraine. The attack left an estimated 100 000 people in the city to be left without heat.

Russia attacked Ukraine with 143 drones overnight but Ukrainian military said it had shot down 95 of them while 46 did not reach their targets, likely thanks to the use of electromagnetic countermeasures that disrupt drone attacks.

"It has nothing to do with hostilities or the frontline situation. This is yet another clear demonstration that Russians are waging war against our people and against life itself in Ukraine. And they are fighting vilely, without easing the pressure. Those who genuinely seek peace and prepare for negotiations do not act this way." A post on X made by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy

He further noted that "repair crews are working tirelessly to restore heating in Mykolaiv. We will continue working with our partners to strengthen defenses against such attacks."

At least one person was injured in the overnight attacks which also damaged houses in the Kyiv region, Ukrainian officials said. The temperature in Mykolaiv is expected to fall to minus 7 degrees Celsius (19.4 Fahrenheit) on Sunday night.

Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Kyiv, said the Ukrainian army announced it has seen an “uptick in attacks by Russian forces” over the past 24 hours.

“In general … we’ve seen no really big gains made by Russian forces for months now – but no indication that the fighting is going down,” he said.
