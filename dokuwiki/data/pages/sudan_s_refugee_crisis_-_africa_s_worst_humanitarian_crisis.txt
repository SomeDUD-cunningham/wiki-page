====Overview====

The Sudanese Refugee Crisis is an ongoing humanitarian crisis that began April 2023. According to the UN News, around 30.4 million people in Sudan, roughly two-thirds of the population, are in need of some form of assistance, like health, food and shelter.

The two factions, being the Rapid Support Forces and the Sudanese Armed forces, have deliberately blocked access of humanitarian aid to Sudan. Combined with crop failures and unemployment, it is a concern that famine could spread throughout Sudan.

By the middle of 2024, there had been 12.5 million people displaced, and over 2.1 million people fleeing from Sudan. The countries with the largest number of Sudanese refugees are Egypt, South Sudan and Chad with roughly 1.2 million, 1.02 million and 748 000 people in these countries respectively according to the UN News. The concurrent situation has made it the largest refugee and displacement crisis in African history.

==== Background ====

On 15 April 2023, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) launched a surprise attack against several Sudanese bases across the country, marking the start of Sudan's fourth civil war. The civil war is fought between the Sudanese armed forces (SAF) under General  General Abdel Fattah al Burhan and the Rapid Support Forces (FSR) under General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemeti. Several minor factions have also participated in the conflict, either siding with one side or opposed to both.
