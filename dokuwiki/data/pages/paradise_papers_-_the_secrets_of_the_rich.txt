====Overview====

The Paradise Papers are a set of 13.4 million electronic files that were leaked from an unknown source to the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. Afterwards, Süddeutsche Zeitung shared the leaked files with the Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) which collaborated with more than 380 journalists across the globe. Some details were made public on 5 November 2017

The Paradise Paper documents contain details of offshore investments. The documents contain emails, loan agreements and other forms of paperwork from the offshore legal firm Appleby, corporate service providers Estera and Asiacti,, as well as company registries from 19 tax jurisdictions.

According to the BBC, the name "Paradise Papers" originates from the term for which many offshore jurisdictions are dubbed, being coined with names like "tax havens" and "tax paradises".
