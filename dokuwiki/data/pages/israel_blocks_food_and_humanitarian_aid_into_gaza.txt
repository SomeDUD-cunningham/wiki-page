On Monday, Israel has closed crossings from Kibbutz of the Kerem Shalom, Erez and Zikis, meaning that vital humanitarian assistance, including thousands of tents, food and another humanitarian aid, will not be delivered to civilians in need.

The United Nations and many Arab states have condemned the blockade of aid into Gaza. Egypt and Qatar have said that the blockade by Israel is being used as a means of war, with Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East stating. "“It is imperative that the ceasefire – a critical lifeline for children – remains in place, and that aid is allowed to flow freely so we can continue to scale up the humanitarian response.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the blockade as Israel attempts to pressure Hamas to agree to a new proposal by the instead for a continuation of phase one through the end of the Holy Month of Ramadan in line with a proposal from the top US envoy to the region that would force Hamas to release all remaining hostages without Israel fully withdrawing from Gaza. Hamas has accused Israel of trying to derail the original ceasefire agreement, calling on Israel to move to the second phase.

Following the start of the ceasefire, it has allowed aid to flow into Gaza with almost 1,000 UNICEF trucks had crossed into the enclave carrying clean water, medical supplies, vaccines, therapeutic food and other materials since 19 January. Moreover, according to the UNICEF, a 100 public schools have opened, giving 100 000 students the ability to return to the classroom.
